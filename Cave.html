        <p>Hello, I’m Hera Dashnyam. I’m a Mongolian undergraduate studying Data Analytics with a concentration in Bioinformatics and Environmental Science at Miami University. I care about building things that are practical, human-centered, and meaningful, whether that’s research that helps vulnerable populations or creative projects that tell a story. I come from a nomadic family that values resilience, humility, and curiosity, and I try to bring those values into everything I do, from volunteering to writing code.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="myjourney" class="content-box">
        <p>I started college early, and I’ve been intentionally designing my academic path to graduate ahead of schedule. Along the way, I’ve balanced my studies with multiple internships, conservation work, and mentoring young students in Mongolia. I’ve volunteered at career fairs, managed buildings on campus, and built presentations for kids about science, law, and the environment because I believe learning should feel exciting, not overwhelming. Most recently, I’ve been conducting transcriptome research with Dr. Chun Liang, identifying novel genes and testing overlaps using RNA-Seq data. It’s technical, but also deeply creative like building a language from fragments.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="whatido" class="content-box">
        <p>Right now, I’m working on a bioinformatics project comparing novel and known genes using complex RNA-seq data structures and transcript overlaps — and yes, it’s as intense as it sounds. This summer, I’ll also be working as an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Shenyue Jia on a public health and climate resilience project. One track explores the risk of power outages for medically vulnerable populations, and the other looks at detecting outages using satellite-based nighttime light data. It’s a perfect blend of data, equity, and real-world impact — and I couldn’t be more excited to contribute.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="whatispire" class="content-box">
        <p>I want to keep creating things that matter. In the long term, I hope to build tools that make environmental data more accessible and human-centered, whether that’s through climate resilience models, health equity maps, or intelligent data systems. I want to work in spaces where I can keep learning, keep building, and keep finding better questions. Whether I’m analyzing satellite images or helping a kid in Mongolia figure out their future, I want my work to quietly support something bigger than myself.</p>
