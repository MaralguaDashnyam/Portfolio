# 🌿 Hera Dashnyam’s Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio — a space where **code meets creativity**, built with care, gifs, gradients, and lots of curiosity.

## 🧚 About This Site

This portfolio is fully custom-coded using:
- **HTML** & **CSS** for structure and styling
- A sprinkle of **JavaScript** for animations and transitions
- Hand-drawn layout and themed buttons with **GIF elements**
- Light responsive design and soft shadows for accessibility

Each page is its own unique little universe — with animated elements, hover effects, and interactive visuals. I designed it to feel more like an experience than a résumé.

## 💻 How It’s Structured

📁 root ├── index.html (main forest page 🌲) ├── Resume.html (with butterfly theme 🦋) ├── Projects.html (woodpecker dashboards 🐦) ├── SkillsTools.html (leafy skill garden 🍃) ├── Cave.html (glittery About Me section ✨) ├── style_*.css (page-specific styling) └── assets (images, GIFs, PDFs, etc.)


> The entire site runs through GitHub Pages — no frameworks or builders used.

## 🛠️ How I Maintain It

- Everything is built with vanilla code — no templates, no drag-and-drop.
- I regularly update my **projects**, **skills**, and **research** work.
- Bugs, visual polish, or new animations are improved as I learn new tools.

## 🌎 Why I Made This

As someone passionate about **data**, **environmental science**, and **design**, I wanted to create a digital space that reflects who I am — not just what I do.

This portfolio isn’t just about showing off. It’s about **storytelling through code**, blending visuals and structure, and quietly supporting something bigger.
